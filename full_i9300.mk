# This file is the build configuration for a full Android
# build for toro hardware. This cleanly combines a set of
# device-specific aspects (drivers) with a device-agnostic
# product configuration (apps). Except for a few implementation
# details, it only fundamentally contains two inherit-product
# lines, full and toro, hence its name.
#

# Inherit from those products. Most specific first.
$(call inherit-product, $(SRC_TARGET_DIR)/product/full_base_telephony.mk)
# This is where we'd set a backup provider if we had one
#$(call inherit-product, device/sample/products/backup_overlay.mk)
$(call inherit-product, device/samsung/i9300/i9300.mk)

# Discard inherited values and use our own instead.
PRODUCT_NAME := full_i9300
